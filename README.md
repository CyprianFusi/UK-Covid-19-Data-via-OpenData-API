# UK-Covid-19-Data-via-OpenData-API
Accessing and analysing UK covid-19 Data from UK Open Data API

This notebook is about:

- Trying out the UK Open Data API
- Requesting data on corona virus from GOV.UK Coronavirus(COVID-19) Open Data API
- Performing some pretty quick and dirty data exploration
- Getting some simple statistics
- Visualising the results
- Analysis of corona virus variants globally was added later
- I could include a notebook with interactive visualisation and annimations because of size limit!
